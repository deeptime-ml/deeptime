        r""" Computes a reweighted count matrix according to Girsanov path reweighting for Markov state models 
        based on the sliding mode, discrete trajectories, a lagtime, the precomputed reweighting factors and
        whether to use sparse matrices.
        Parameters
        ----------
        count_mode : str
            The counting mode to be used so far is "sliding".
            See :meth:`__init__` for a more detailed description.
        dtrajs : array_like or list of array_like
            Discrete trajectories, i.e., a list of arrays which contain non-negative integer values. A single ndarray
            can also be passed, which is then treated as if it was a list with that one ndarray in it.
        lagtime : int
            Distance between two frames in the discretized trajectories under which their potential change of state
            is considered a transition.
        sparse : bool, default=False
            Whether to use sparse matrices or dense matrices. Sparse matrices can make sense when dealing with a lot of
            states.
        Returns
        -------
        count_matrix : (N, N) ndarray or sparse array
            The computed count matrix. Can be ndarray or sparse depending on whether sparse was set to true or false.
            N is the number of encountered states, i.e., :code:`np.max(dtrajs)+1`.
