class TRAMDataset(Dataset):
    r""" Dataset for organizing data and obtaining properties from data that are needed for TRAM.
    The minimum required parameters for constructing a TRAMDataset are the `dtrajs` and `bias_matrices`. In this case,
    `ttrajs` are inferred from the shape of the `dtrajs`, by assuming each trajectory in `dtrajs` corresponds to a
    unique thermodynamic state, with the index corresponding to the index of occurrence in `dtrajs`.

    The values at identical indices in `dtrajs`, `ttrajs` and `bias_matrices` correspond to the sample. For example, at
    indices `(i, n)` we find information about the :math:`n`-th sample in trajectory :math:`i`. `dtrajs[i][n]` gives us
    the index of the Markov state the sample falls into. `ttrajs[i][n]` gives us the thermodynamic state the sample was
    sampled at (which may be different from other samples in the trajectory due to a replica exchange swap occurring at
    index :math:`n`). Finally, `bias_matrices[i][n]` gives us for each thermodynamic state, the energy of the sample
    evaluated at that thermodynamic state. In other words: `bias_matrices[i][n][k]` gives us :math:`b^k(x_i^n)`, i.e.
    the bias energy as if the sample were observed in thermodynamic state :math:`k`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtrajs : array-like(ndarray(n)), int
        The discrete trajectories in the form of a list or array of numpy arrays. `dtrajs[i]` contains one trajectory.
        `dtrajs[i][n]` contains the Markov state index that the :math:`n`-th sample from the :math:`i`-th trajectory was
        binned into. Each of the dtrajs can be of variable length.
    bias_matrices : array-like(ndarray(n,m)), float
        The bias energy matrices. `bias_matrices[i][n, k]` contains the bias energy of the :math:`n`-th sample from the
        :math:`i`-th trajectory, evaluated at thermodynamic state :math:`k`, i.e. :math:`b^k(x_{i,n})`. The bias energy
        matrices should have the same size as `dtrajs` in both the first and second dimension. The third dimension is of
        size `n_therm_state`, i.e. for each sample, the bias energy in every thermodynamic state is calculated and
        stored in the `bias_matrices`.
    ttrajs : array-like(ndarray(n)), int, optional
        `ttrajs[i]` contains for each sample in the :math:`i`-th trajectory the index of the thermodynamic state that
        sample was sampled at. If `ttrajs = None`, we assume no replica exchange was done. In this case we assume each
        trajectory  corresponds to a unique thermodynamic state, and `n_therm_states` equals the size of `dtrajs`.
    n_therm_states : int, optional
        if `n_therm_states` is given, the indices in `ttrajs` are checked to lie within `n_therm_states` bound.
        Otherwise, `n_therm_states` are inferred from the highest occurring index in `ttrajs`.
    n_markov_states : int, optional
        if `n_markov_states` is given, the indices in `dtrajs` are checked to lie within `n_markov_states` bound.
        Otherwise, `n_markov_states` are inferred from the highest occurring index in `dtrajs`.
    lagtime : int, optional, default=1
        Integer lag time at which transitions are counted.
    count_mode : str, optional, default='sliding'
        One of "sample", "sliding", "sliding-effective", and "effective".

        * "sample" strides the trajectory with lagtime :math:`\tau` and uses the strided counts as transitions.
        * "sliding" uses a sliding window approach, yielding counts that are statistically correlated and too
          large by a factor of :math:`\tau`; in uncertainty estimation this yields wrong uncertainties.
        * "sliding-effective" takes "sliding" and divides it by :math:`\tau`, which can be shown to provide a
          likelihood that is the geometrical average over shifted subsamples of the trajectory,
          :math:`(s_1,\:s_{tau+1},\:...),\:(s_2,\:t_{tau+2},\:...),` etc. This geometrical average converges to
          the correct likelihood in the statistical limit :footcite:`trendelkamp2015estimation`.
        * "effective" uses an estimate of the transition counts that are statistically uncorrelated.
          Recommended when estimating Bayesian MSMs.

        The data is then restricted to the largest connected set and count models are recomputed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        connectivity : str, optional, default="post_hoc_RE"
            One of None, "post_hoc_RE", "BAR_variance", or "summed_count_matrix".
            Defines what should be considered a connected set in the joint (product) space of conformations and
            thermodynamic ensembles. If connectivity=None, the data is not restricted.

            * "post_hoc_RE" : It is required that every state in the connected set can be reached by following a
              pathway of reversible transitions or jumping between overlapping thermodynamic states while staying in
              the same Markov state. A reversible transition between two Markov states (within the same thermodynamic
              state :math:`k`) is a pair of Markov states that belong to the same strongly connected component of the
              count matrix (from thermodynamic state :math:`k`). Two thermodynamic states :math:`k` and :math:`l` are
              defined to overlap at Markov state :math:`i` if a replica exchange simulation
              :footcite:`hukushima1996exchange` restricted to state :math:`i` would show at least one transition from
              :math:`k` to :math:`l` or one transition from from :math:`l` to :math:`k`. The expected number of replica
              exchanges is estimated from the simulation data. The minimal number required of replica exchanges per
              Markov state can be increased by decreasing `connectivity_factor`.
            * "BAR_variance" : like 'post_hoc_RE' but with a different condition to define the thermodynamic overlap
              based on the variance of the BAR estimator :footcite:`shirts2008statistically`.
              Two thermodynamic states :math:`k` and :math:`l` are defined to overlap at Markov state :math:`i` if the
              variance of the free energy difference :math:`\Delta f_{kl}` computed with BAR
              (and restricted to conformations form Markov state :math:`i`) is less or equal than one. The minimally
              required variance can be controlled with `connectivity_factor`.
            * "summed_count_matrix" : all thermodynamic states are assumed to overlap. The connected set is then
              computed by summing the count matrices over all thermodynamic states and taking its largest strongly
              connected set. Not recommended!
        connectivity_factor : float, optional, default=1.0
            Only needed if connectivity="post_hoc_RE" or "BAR_variance". Values greater than 1.0 weaken the connectivity
            conditions. For 'post_hoc_RE' this multiplies the number of hypothetically observed transitions. For
            'BAR_variance' this scales the threshold for the minimal allowed variance of free energy differences.
        progress : object
