class TRAM(_MSMBaseEstimator):
    r"""Transition(-based) Reweighting Analysis Method.
    TRAM is described in :footcite:`wu2016multiensemble`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lagtime : int
        Integer lag time at which transitions are counted.
    count_mode : str
        One of "sample", "sliding", "sliding-effective", and "effective".

        * "sample" strides the trajectory with lagtime :math:`\tau` and uses the strided counts as transitions.
        * "sliding" uses a sliding window approach, yielding counts that are statistically correlated and too
          large by a factor of :math:`\tau`; in uncertainty estimation this yields wrong uncertainties.
        * "sliding-effective" takes "sliding" and divides it by :math:`\tau`, which can be shown to provide a
          likelihood that is the geometrical average over shifted subsamples of the trajectory,
          :math:`(s_1,\:s_{tau+1},\:...),\:(s_2,\:t_{tau+2},\:...),` etc. This geometrical average converges to
          the correct likelihood in the statistical limit :footcite:`trendelkamp2015estimation`.
        * "effective" uses an estimate of the transition counts that are statistically uncorrelated.
          Recommended when estimating Bayesian MSMs.
    connectivity : str, optional, default='post_hoc_RE'
        One of 'post_hoc_RE', 'BAR_variance', or 'summed_count_matrix'.
        Defines what should be considered a connected set in the joint (product) space
        of conformations and thermodynamic ensembles.

        * 'post_hoc_RE' : It is required that every state in the connected set can be reached by following a
          pathway of reversible transitions or jumping between overlapping thermodynamic states while staying in
          the same Markov state. A reversible transition between two Markov states (within the same thermodynamic
          state k) is a pair of Markov states that belong to the same strongly connected component of the count
          matrix (from thermodynamic state k). Two thermodynamic states k and l are defined to overlap at Markov
          state n if a replica exchange simulation :footcite:`hukushima1996exchange` restricted to state n would
          show at least one transition from k to l or one transition from from l to k.
          The expected number of replica exchanges is estimated from
          the simulation data. The minimal number required of replica exchanges per Markov state can be increased by
          decreasing `connectivity_factor`.
        * 'BAR_variance' : like 'post_hoc_RE' but with a different condition to define the thermodynamic overlap
          based on the variance of the BAR estimator :footcite:`shirts2008statistically`.
          Two thermodynamic states k and l are defined to overlap
          at Markov state n if the variance of the free energy difference Delta :math:`f_{kl}` computed with BAR (and
          restricted to conformations form Markov state n) is less or equal than one. The minimally required variance
          can be controlled with `connectivity_factor`.
        * 'summed_count_matrix' : all thermodynamic states are assumed to overlap. The connected set is then
          computed by summing the count matrices over all thermodynamic states and taking its largest strongly
          connected set. Not recommended!
    maxiter : int, optional, default=10000
        The maximum number of self-consistent iterations before the estimator exits unsuccessfully.
    maxerr : float, optional, default=1E-15
        Convergence criterion based on the maximal free energy change in a self-consistent
        iteration step.
    save_convergence_info : int, optional, default=0
        Every saveConvergenceInfo iteration steps, store the actual increment and the actual log-likelihood; 0
        means no storage.
    connectivity_factor : float, optional, default=1.0
        Only needed if connectivity='post_hoc_RE' or 'BAR_variance'. Values greater than 1.0 weaken the connectivity
        conditions. For 'post_hoc_RE' this multiplies the number of hypothetically observed transitions. For
        'BAR_variance' this scales the threshold for the minimal allowed variance of free energy differences.
    progress_bar : object
        Progress bar object that TRAM will call to indicate progress to the user.
        Tested for a tqdm progress bar. Should implement update() and close() and have .total and .desc properties.
