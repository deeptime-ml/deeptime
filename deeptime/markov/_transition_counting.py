class TransitionCountModel(Model):
    r""" Statistics, count matrices, and connectivity from discrete trajectories. These statistics can be used to, e.g.,
    construct MSMs. This model can create submodels (see :func:`submodel`)
    that are restricted to a certain selection of states. This subselection can be made by

    * analyzing the connected sets of the
      count matrix (:func:`connected_sets`)
    * pruning states by thresholding with a mincount_connectivity parameter,
    * or simply providing a subset of states manually.

    Parameters
    ----------
    count_matrix : (N, N) ndarray or sparse matrix
        The count matrix. In case it was estimated with 'sliding', it contains a factor of `lagtime` more counts
        than are statistically uncorrelated.
    counting_mode : str, optional, default=None
        If not None, one of 'sliding', 'sample', or 'effective'.
        Indicates the counting method that was used to estimate the count matrix. In case of 'sliding', a sliding
        window of the size of the lagtime was used to count transitions. It therefore contains a factor
        of `lagtime` more counts than are statistically uncorrelated. It's fine to use this matrix for maximum
        likelihood estimation, but it will give far too small errors if you use it for uncertainty calculations.
        In order to do uncertainty calculations, use the effective count matrix, see
        :attr:`effective_count_matrix`, divide this count matrix by tau, or use 'effective' as estimation parameter.
    lagtime : int, optional, default=1
        The time offset which was used to count transitions in state.
    state_histogram : array_like, optional, default=None
        Histogram over the visited states in discretized trajectories.
    state_symbols : array_like or DiscreteStatesManager, optional, default=None
        Symbols of the original discrete trajectory that are represented in the counting model. If None, the
        symbols are assumed to represent the data, i.e., a iota range over the number of states. Subselection
        of the model also subselects the symbols.
    count_matrix_full : array_like, optional, default=None
        Count matrix for all state symbols. If None, the count matrix provided as first argument is assumed to
        take that role.
    state_histogram_full : array_like, optional, default=None
        Histogram over all state symbols. If None, the provided state_histogram  is assumed to take that role.

class TransitionCountEstimator(EstimatorTransformer):
    r"""
    Estimator which produces a :class:`TransitionCountModel` given discretized trajectories.
    Hereby one can decide whether the count mode should be:

        * sample: A trajectory of length T will have :math:`T / \tau` counts at time indices

          .. math:: (0 \rightarrow \tau), (\tau \rightarrow 2 \tau), ..., (((T/ \tau )-1) \tau \rightarrow T)

          .. math:: (0 \rightarrow \tau), (1 \rightarrow \tau+1), ..., (T-\tau-1 \rightarrow T-1)

          This introduces an overestimation of the actual count values by a factor of "lagtime". For
          maximum-likelihood MSMs this plays no role but it leads to wrong error bars in uncertainty estimation.

        * sliding-effective: See sliding mode, just that the resulting count matrix is divided by the lagtime after
          counting. This which can be shown to provide a likelihood that is the geometrical average
          over shifted subsamples of the trajectory, :math:`(s_1,\:s_{tau+1},\:...),\:(s_2,\:t_{tau+2},\:...),` etc.
          This geometrical average converges to the correct likelihood in the statistical limit
          :footcite:`trendelkamp2015estimation`.

        * effective: Uses an estimate of the transition counts that are statistically uncorrelated. Recommended
          when used with a Bayesian MSM. A description of the estimation procedure
          can be found in :footcite:`noe2015statistical`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lagtime : int
        Distance between two frames in the discretized trajectories under which their potential change of state
        is considered a transition.
    count_mode : str
        One of "sample", "sliding", "sliding-effective", and "effective".

        * "sample" strides the trajectory with lagtime :math:`\tau` and uses the strided counts as transitions.
        * "sliding" uses a sliding window approach, yielding counts that are statistically correlated and too
          large by a factor of :math:`\tau`; in uncertainty estimation this yields wrong uncertainties.
        * "sliding-effective" takes "sliding" and divides it by :math:`\tau`, which can be shown to provide a
          likelihood that is the geometrical average over shifted subsamples of the trajectory,
          :math:`(s_1,\:s_{tau+1},\:...),\:(s_2,\:t_{tau+2},\:...),` etc. This geometrical average converges to
          the correct likelihood in the statistical limit :footcite:`trendelkamp2015estimation`.
        * "effective" uses an estimate of the transition counts that are statistically uncorrelated.
          Recommended when estimating Bayesian MSMs.
    n_states : int, optional, default=None
        Normally, the shape of the count matrix is a consequence of the number of encountered states in given
        discrete trajectories. However sometimes (for instance when scoring), only a portion of the discrete
        trajectories is passed but the count matrix should still have the correct shape. Then, this argument
        can be used to artificially set the number of states to the correct value.
    sparse : bool, optional, default=False

        Parameters
        ----------
        count_mode : str
            The counting mode to use. One of "sample", "sliding", "sliding-effective", and "effective".
            See :meth:`__init__` for a more detailed description.
        dtrajs : array_like or list of array_like
            Discrete trajectories, i.e., a list of arrays which contain non-negative integer values. A single ndarray
            can also be passed, which is then treated as if it was a list with that one ndarray in it.
        lagtime : int
            Distance between two frames in the discretized trajectories under which their potential change of state
            is considered a transition.
        sparse : bool, default=False
            Whether to use sparse matrices or dense matrices. Sparse matrices can make sense when dealing with a lot of
            states.
        n_jobs : int, optional, default=None
            This only has an effect in effective counting. Determines the number of cores to use for estimating
            statistical inefficiencies. Default resolves to number of available cores.

        Returns
        -------
        count_matrix : (N, N) ndarray or sparse array
            The computed count matrix. Can be ndarray or sparse depending on whether sparse was set to true or false.
            N is the number of encountered states, i.e., :code:`np.max(dtrajs)+1`.
